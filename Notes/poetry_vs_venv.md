# Poetry vs Python `venv` for Virtual Environments

## Introduction
Both **Poetry** and Python’s built-in `venv` module create virtual environments, but they differ in how they manage dependencies and workflows. This guide explains their differences and helps you choose the best tool for your needs.

---

## 1. Creating a Virtual Environment Using `venv` (Traditional Method)

### 🔹 How it works
- Python’s built-in `venv` module creates an isolated environment.
- You manually activate the environment and install dependencies using `pip`.
- Dependency versions are managed through `requirements.txt`.

### 🛠️ Steps to create and use a virtual environment with `venv`
```sh
# Step 1: Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv  

# Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
myenv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Step 3: Install a package
pip install requests  

# Step 4: Save dependencies
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
✅ Pros
	•	Built-in: No need to install extra tools.
	•	Lightweight: Works with any package manager (pip, pip-tools).
	•	Universal: Supported in any Python project.

❌ Cons
	•	Manual dependency management: You need to track requirements.txt yourself.
	•	No automatic resolution: You must manually resolve version conflicts.
	•	Not ideal for publishing: Lacks built-in support for packaging and dependency versioning.


## 2. Creating a Virtual Environment Using Poetry

### 🔹 How it works
- **Poetry automates** virtual environment creation and dependency management.
- It uses `pyproject.toml` instead of `requirements.txt`.
- It **automatically resolves** dependency conflicts.

### 🛠️ Steps to create and use a virtual environment with Poetry
```sh
# Step 1: Install Poetry (if not installed)
pip install poetry  

# Step 2: Create a new project with Poetry
poetry new myproject  
cd myproject  

# Step 3: Install dependencies and create a virtual environment
poetry init -n

# Step 4: Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell  

# Step 5: Add dependencies
poetry add requests  

# Step 6: Remove dependencies
poetry remove requests  
```

✅ Pros
	•	Automates dependency management: No need for requirements.txt.
	•	Built-in dependency resolution: Automatically finds compatible versions.
	•	Supports package publishing: Easily publish Python packages.

❌ Cons
	•	Requires installation: venv is built-in, but Poetry is not.
	•	Learning curve: Different from traditional pip and venv workflows.
