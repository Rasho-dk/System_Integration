# What is a migration?

A migration is a way to define changes to the database. 

An alternative to having a single SQL file. 

*What are the two types of migrations that exist?*

---

# Two types of migrations

1. Schema migration (DDL)

2. Data migration / Seeding (DML)

  - Data migration usually refers to moving data from one database to another.

  - Seeding is the process of populating a database with data, usually a new database.

Confusingly, they are all referred to as simply migration.

# Schema Migration DDL

Schema Migration DDL (Data Definition Language) consists of SQL commands used to modify a database schema during migrations.  

## Key Commands  
- **CREATE** ‚Äì Add new tables, indexes, or constraints.  
- **ALTER** ‚Äì Modify existing tables (e.g., add/drop columns, change data types).  
- **DROP** ‚Äì Remove tables, indexes, or constraints.  
- **TRUNCATE** ‚Äì Clear all records from a table without logging individual row deletions.  
- **RENAME** ‚Äì Rename tables or columns.  



# How migrations can help you in your project

1. Changes to the schema. Propagating the change for the developers or in production.

2. Migrating data from SQLite to the new database.

3. Backing up the database. (Better solutions might exist here depending on your chosen database).

4. Once you implement web scraping and web crawling, you could use batch seeding to add data en masse to your database.

# Benefits of migrations

* You can easily setup a new database from scratch.

* You can automatically apply a migration to the production database through your pipelines when you deploy.

* You can propagate changes to the schema to other developers. It's basically version control for databases.

* You can easily rollback a migration if something goes wrong.

## 1. DDL ‚Äì Data Definition Language

**What is it?**  
DDL stands for *Data Definition Language*. It includes SQL commands used to define, create, and modify the structure of database objects such as tables, schemas, indexes, and relationships.

**Purpose:**  
- To build or alter the database structure.

**Common Commands:**
- `CREATE`
- `ALTER`
- `DROP`
- `TRUNCATE`

**Examples:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INT
);

ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(255);

DROP TABLE teachers;
```

## 2. DML ‚Äì Data Manipulation Language

**What is it?**  
DML stands for *Data Manipulation Language*. It handles the data itself within the database structures.

**Purpose:**  
- To insert, retrieve, update, or delete records in the tables.

**Common Commands:**
- `INSERT`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`

**Examples:**
```sql
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 20);

UPDATE courses SET credits = 5 WHERE course_id = 101;

DELETE FROM teachers WHERE id = 3;
```

**Use Case:**  
You use DML to populate the database with actual content ‚Äî the real data your app or system uses.

---

## 3. DCL ‚Äì Data Control Language

**What is it?**  
DCL stands for *Data Control Language*. It is used for managing access and permissions in the database.

**Purpose:**  
- To control who can do what in the database.

**Common Commands:**
- `GRANT`
- `REVOKE`

**Examples:**
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON students TO user123;

REVOKE UPDATE ON courses FROM user123;
```

**Use Case:**  
You use DCL to set security and user privileges, defining who can view or change parts of the database.

## üì¶ Putting It All Together ‚Äì ‚ÄúRecreate the Database‚Äù

When someone says ‚Äúeverything needed to recreate the database,‚Äù they mean:

1. **DDL** ‚Äì To rebuild the structure.
2. **DML** ‚Äì To refill it with the same data.
3. **DCL** ‚Äì To restore the correct permissions.

In practice, you‚Äôd export or script all these statements into a `.sql` file. If the database were lost or corrupted, you could run that script and restore it exactly as it was.





# Notes from lecture
poetry add alembic sqlalchemy psycopg2
alembic : database-migrationsv√¶rkt√∏j
sqlalchemy : OMR
 psycopg2 : postgrespoetry run alembic init alembic   # initialize alembicvi kan se i python : alembic.ini som ligner knex file in npm

alembic revicion -m "create accounts table"

alembic upgrade head 

alembic downgrade -1 # rollback ; -1 rolleback en file ; det er ikke som transaction 

Hvis vi skal have Seeding og i alembic s√• kan det lave i en koncept i migrations 

n√•r vi lukker docker-compose and run det igen vil det vise det samme data pga. volume

Det er vigtgit at backup af database

* MangoDb have binar data (schema less kan ogs√• brug $jsonSchema)
* mro vs MRO (det er for dokumention - det er til objekter)
* npx (init packer i cache mens vi k√∏rer. modsat af npm instalere p√• pc)
* npx mro for docs. i html fx. 
* forkellige paradimer opgaver mssql og nu vil bruge postgres

* firestore real-time data og det virker uden credentional 

* vi kan se i python : alembic.ini som ligner knex file in npm

* FireStore er databsae for firebase fra google

* Eksam: 
 - Hvordan kunne man migratere database ?
 - hvordan man tager backup
