Servers
a|
* Can work with modules in Javascript and Python. Knows why we use ES6 modules in Javascript and why it matters to a course focused on integration.
* Can argue about different build tools for Python and understands their pros and cons.
* Can use poetry.
* Understands encoding, serializing and marshalling. Knows about charsets and encoding types.
