**Type**: Individual

Of course, you don't need to do anything if you already have these. Check if you do by running different versions of `--v`, `-v`, `--version` etc. or just run the command.

### Install Node.js. 

Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download

### Install Postman and create account

Create an account. We will be using features that require the non-lightweight version as they call it. You can use a throwaway email to signup.

Python comes preinstalled on all operating systems but make sure that you can run Python on your computer.

```powershell
$ Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
