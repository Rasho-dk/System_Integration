Although there is no statutory authority in the Maine Revised Statues for a filing agreement, the basis and requirements for this type of disposition is found in Maine Rule of Criminal Procedure 11B, which reads as follows:\n", "Rule 11B.  Filing Agreements\n", "   (a) In General. The attorney for the state and the defendant may enter into a written filing agreement respecting a pending indictment, information or complaint. The filing agreement must establish a definite filing period of up to one year subject to the conditions, if any, set forth in the filing agreement. Upon execution of the agreement by the parties, the state shall file the agreement forthwith in the trial court and, upon such filing, the agreement will become effective.\n", "   (b) Court Approval Unnecessary. The approval of the court for the filing of a written filing agreement by the parties is unnecessary; however, a filing agreement is subject to the control of the court. If the agreement calls for the payment by the defendant of costs of prosecution such agreed-upon costs may be in any amount up to, but not exceeding, the maximum authorized fine amount for the particular crime based upon its sentencing class and need not reflect the actual costs of prosecution.\n", "   (c) Disposition During or at Expiration of Filing Period. Except where a filing agreement expressly provides otherwise as specified in subdivision (d), if the defendant has satisfied each of the filing agreement's conditions, if any, at the conclusion of the agreed upon filing period the defendant is entitled to have the filed indictment, information or complaint dismissed with prejudice. In this regard, unless the attorney for the state files a motion alleging a violation of one or more of the agreement's conditions by the defendant and seeking to have the criminal proceeding in which the indictment, information or complaint was filed reactivated by the court, at the expiration of the filing period the clerk shall enter a dismissal of the filed charging instrument with prejudice. In the event the attorney for the state files a motion during or at the end of the filing period alleging a violation of one or more of the agreement's conditions, the attorney for the state is entitled to have the criminal proceeding reactivated by the court if, following a hearing on the motion, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has violated one or more of the agreement's conditions.\n", "\n   (d) Special Reservations in the Filing Agreement. If the attorney for the state wishes to preserve the right to reinitiate a criminal proceeding after the filing period has fully run when no breach of conditions has occurred, or to preserve the right to initiate the same or additional criminal charges against the defendant arising out of the same event or conduct in a separate criminal proceeding while the filing period is running, the attorney for the state must expressly reserve such a right in the written filing agreement and the defendant must expressly agree to it.", "As a practical matter, from the standpoint of a defendant in a criminal matter, a filing agreement is a very favorable means to resolve the case in that it does not require the defendant to enter a guilty plea or admit to conduct.  Furthermore, the conditions on a filing agreement are typically less onerous on a defendant and in the event that the Defendant fails to abide by the conditions of the filing agreement, the State has to move the Court to restore the case back to the docket, which, if granted, affords the Defendant an opportunity to again fight the charges.\n", "The second type of deferred adjudication in Maine is what is known as a deferred disposition. Unlike a filing agreement, there is statutory authority under 17-A M.R.S.A. § 1348 et. seq. for a deferred disposition.  Furthermore, unlike a filing agreement, a deferred disposition requires the defendant to enter a plea of guilty in the matter before having the sentence deferred while the deferred disposition agreement is in effect. In Maine, a deferred disposition is only available for defendants charged with either a class E or D misdemeanor, or a class C felony. A deferred disposition is not available for juvenile matters or for class A or B felonies.", "\n", "In general, the requirements of deferred dispositions are controlled by 17-A M.R.S.A. § 1348-A, which reads as follows:\n", "Deferred disposition\n", "   1. Following the acceptance of a plea of guilty for a crime for which a person is eligible for a deferred disposition under section 1348, the court may order sentencing deferred to a date certain or determinable and impose requirements upon the person, to be in effect during the period of deferment, considered by the court to be reasonable and appropriate to assist the person to lead a law-abiding life. The court-imposed deferment requirements must include a requirement that the person refrain from criminal conduct and may include a requirement that the person pay to the appropriate county an administrative supervision fee of not more than $50 per month, as determined by the court, for the term of the deferment. In determining the amount of the fee, the court shall take into account the financial resources of the person and the nature of the burden its payment imposes. In exchange for the deferred sentencing, the person shall abide by the court-imposed deferment requirements. Unless the court orders otherwise, the requirements are immediately in effect.\n", "   2. During the period of deferment and upon application of the person granted deferred disposition pursuant to subsection 1 or of the attorney for the State or upon the court's own motion, the court may, after a hearing upon notice to the attorney for the State and the person, modify the requirements imposed by the court, add further requirements or relieve the person of any requirement imposed by the court that, in the court's opinion, imposes an unreasonable burden on the person.\n", "   3. During the period of deferment, if the person cannot meet a deferment requirement imposed by the court, the person shall bring a motion pursuant to subsection 2.\n", "\n   4. For purposes of a deferred disposition, a person is deemed to have been convicted when the court imposes the sentence.", "The resolution of a deferred disposition is controlled by 17-A M.R.S.A. § 1348-B, which requires that the Court hold a sentencing hearing wherein the defendant has the burden by showing as a preponderance of the evidence that they have complied with the terms of the deferred disposition agreement.  If the defendant can make such a showing then the Court will follow whichever resolution is contained in the agreement, which is usually to allow the defendant to withdraw their plea and dismiss the matter.  However a dismissal is not guaranteed as the agreement may call for the State to introduce a new lesser charge to which the defendant will enter a plea to and be sentenced as per the terms of the deferred disposition agreement.  If the defendant cannot show by a preponderance of the evidence that they have complied with the deferred disposition agreement, then the Court will proceed to sentence the defendant on the original charge as per the terms of the agreement.   If during the course of the agreement, the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the defendant is not complying with the deferred disposition agreement or has committed new criminal conduct, the prosecutor may then move the Court to terminate the deferred disposition and impose sentence on the original charge.  The Court will set a hearing on this motion, where the prosecutor must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant failed to comply.", "\n", "Again as a practical matter from the standpoint of the defendant, a deferred disposition in Maine should be entered into cautiously as the Court as a defendant is required to enter a plea of guilty in order to put the agreement in effect.  The consequence of this is that if the defendant fails to comply with the agreement, they are not afforded the opportunity to fight the charge as with a filing agreement because a plea has already been entered.  Rather, if the Court finds that the defendant failed to meet the terms of the deferred disposition, the Court will impose sentence on the original charge and the conviction will stand.\n", "In the State of Texas, deferred adjudication is not treated as a criminal conviction as a matter of law; however, there is no easy way to remove the record of the case from one's background.  This creates difficulties with private entities performing background checks such as employers and apartment complexes, as they can see the case, charge and its outcome, and often simply treat it the same as though it were a conviction for purposes of their review. Also, those who fill out an application for a ", " (or any other state license with the exception of a Texas Driver License or state issued ID card) the Deferred Adjudication charge must be disclosed (for CHL applications if the Deferred Adjudication is over 5 years old the individual is eligible to apply but has to disclose their criminal past). To date the State of Texas has passed into law the Order of Nondisclosure where criminal justice agencies (law enforcement, community supervision e.g. probation) are prohibited from disclosing to the public criminal history record information related to the offense for which defendant successfully completed deferred adjudication community supervision. There are limitations where some criminal offenses (from sex offenses, family violence, dating violence) do not allow an Order of Nondisclosure to be filed - felony offenses (in the State of Texas) have a 5-year waiting period, some misdemeanors 2 years, and misdemeanors not listed under the 2-year waiting period can be filed immediately.\n", "Under U.S. immigration law (pre or post-9/11 which also includes the worded language of the ", ") if the defendant is an ", " charged for a criminal offense, deferred adjudication is considered a conviction where once the sentence is discharged (completed) ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) can have the individual deported from the United States to the country of origin.

Cooke & Wheatstone received a British patent covering telegraphy in 1837 and a second one in 1840 which described a type-printing telegraph with steel type fixed at the tips of petals of a rotating brass daisy-wheel, struck by an \"electric hammer\" to print Roman letters through carbon paper onto a moving paper tape.", " In 1841 ", " devised an electromagnetic printing telegraph machine. It used pulses of electricity created by rotating a dial over contact points to release and stop a type-wheel turned by weight-driven clockwork; a second clockwork mechanism rotated a drum covered with a sheet of paper and moved it slowly upwards so that the type-wheel printed its signals in a spiral. The critical issue was to have the sending and receiving elements working synchronously. Bain attempted to achieve this using ", " to closely regulate the speed of the clockwork. It was patented, along with other devices, on April 21, 1841.", "\n", "By 1846, the ", " telegraph service was operational between Washington, D.C., and New York.

Each piano key represented a letter of the alphabet and when pressed caused the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. A \"shift\" key gave each main key two optional values. A 56-character typewheel at the sending end was synchronised to coincide with a similar wheel at the receiving end. If the key corresponding to a particular character was pressed at the home station, it actuated the typewheel at the distant station just as the same character moved into the printing position, in a way similar to the (much later) ", ". It was thus an example of a synchronous data transmission system. House's equipment could transmit around 40 instantly readable words per minute, but was difficult to manufacture in bulk.

Although it is a subject of considerable debate, many scholars hold that these actually describe two separate events.", "\n", "Jesus' response to the anointing in Luke is completely different from that recorded in the other gospels to the anointing in their accounts.

As one commentator notes, \"Luke is the only one to record the parable of the two debtors, and he chooses to preserve it in this setting. ...If one considers the other gospel accounts as a variation of the same event, it is likely that the parable is not authentically set. Otherwise, the powerful message from the parable located in this setting would likely be preserved elsewhere, too. However, if one considers the story historically accurate, happening in Jesus' life apart from the similar incidents recorded in the other gospels, the question of the authenticity of the parable receives a different answer. ...John Nolland, following Wilckens' ideas, writes: 'There can hardly be a prior form of the episode not containing the present parable, since this would leave the Pharisee's concerns of v 39 with no adequate response'.\"", "\n", "In chapter 10 of the ", ", Jesus visits the home of two sisters named Mary and Martha, living in an unnamed village. Mary is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was \"cumbered about many things\"", " while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen \"the better part\", that of listening to the master's discourse.", "\n", "As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, He came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called ", ", who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, \"Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!\"\n\"Martha, Martha,\" the Lord answered, \"you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed. ", " has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.\"", "For Mary to sit at Jesus' feet, and for him to allow her to do so, was itself controversial. In doing so, as one commentator notes, Mary took \"the place of a disciple by sitting at the feet of the teacher. It was unusual for a woman in first-century Judaism to be accepted by a teacher as a disciple.\"", "\n", "Most Christian commentators have been ready to assume that the two occurrences of sisters named as Mary and Martha refer the same pair of sisters.\n", "In medieval ", " tradition, Mary of Bethany was identified as ", " perhaps in large part because of a ", " given by ", " in which he taught about several women in the New Testament as though they were the same person.", " This led to a conflation of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene as well as with another woman (beside Mary of Bethany who anointed Jesus), and the woman caught in adultery. ", " never adopted this identification. In his article in the 1910 ", ", ", " stated, \"The Greek Fathers, as a whole, distinguish the three persons: the 'sinner' of ", "; the sister of Martha and Lazarus, ", " and ", "; and Mary Magdalen.\"", "\n", "Father Hugh Pope enumerated the accounts of each of these three persons (the unnamed \"sinner\", Mary Magdalene, and Mary of Bethany) in the Gospel of Luke and concluded that, based on these accounts, \"there is no suggestion of an identification of the three persons, and if we had only Luke to guide us we should certainly have no grounds for so identifying them [as the same person].\" He then explains first the position, at that time general among Catholics, equating Mary of Bethany with the sinful woman of Luke by referring to ", ", where Mary is identified as the woman who anointed Jesus, and noting that this reference is given before John's account of the anointing in Bethany:\n", "John, however, clearly identifies Mary of Bethany with the woman who anointed Christ's feet (12; cf. ", " and ", "). It is remarkable that already in ", ", John has spoken of Mary as \"she that anointed the Lord's feet\", ", ". It is commonly said that he refers to the subsequent anointing which he himself describes in ", "; but it may be questioned whether he would have used ", " if another woman, and she a \"sinner\" in the city, had done the same. It is conceivable that John, just because he is writing so long after the event and at a time when Mary was dead, wishes to point out to us that she was really the same as the \"sinner\". In the same way Luke may have veiled her identity precisely because he did not wish to defame one who was yet living; he certainly does something similar in the case of St. Matthew whose identity with Levi the publican (5:27) he conceals. If the foregoing argument holds good, Mary of Bethany and the \"sinner\" are one and the same.", "Hugh Pope then explained the identification of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene by the presumption that, because of Jesus' high praise of her deed of anointing him, it would be incredible that she should also not have been at his crucifixion and resurrection. Since Mary Magdalene is reported to have been present on those occasions, by this reasoning, she must therefore be the same person as Mary of Bethany:\n", "An examination of John's Gospel makes it almost impossible to deny the identity of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalen. From John we learn the name of the \"woman\" who anointed Christ's feet previous to the last supper. We may remark here that it seems unnecessary to hold that because Matthew and Mark say \"two days before the Passover\", while John says \"six days\" there were, therefore, two distinct anointings following one another. John does not necessarily mean that the supper and the anointing took place six days before, but only that Christ came to Bethany six days before the Passover. At that supper, then, Mary received the glorious encomium, \"she hath wrought a good work upon Me. ...In pouring this ointment upon My body she hath done it for My burial. ...Wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached ... that also which she hath done shall be told for a memory of her.\" Is it credible, in view of all this, that this Mary should have no place at the foot of the cross, nor at the tomb of Christ? Yet it is Mary Magdalen who, according to all the Evangelists, stood at the foot of the cross and assisted at the entombment and was the first recorded witness of the Resurrection. And while John calls her \"Mary Magdalen\" in 19:25, 20:1, and 20:18, he calls her simply \"Mary\" in 20:11 and 20:16.", "French scholar Victor Saxer dates the identification of Mary Magdalene as a prostitute, and as Mary of Bethany, to a sermon by Pope Gregory the Great on 21 September 591 A.D., where he seemed to combine the actions of three women mentioned in the New Testament and also identified an unnamed woman as Mary Magdalene. In another sermon, Gregory specifically identified Mary Magdalene as the sister of Martha mentioned in Luke 10.", " But according to a view expressed more recently by theologian Jane Schaberg, Gregory only put the final touch to a legend that already existed before him.", "\n", "Western Christianity's identification of Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany was reflected in the arrangement of the ", ", until this was altered in 1969,", " reflecting the fact that by then the common interpretation in the Catholic Church was that Mary of Bethany, Mary Magdalene and the sinful woman who anointed the feet of Jesus were three distinct women.", "\n", "In Orthodox Church tradition, Mary of Bethany is honored as a separate individual from Mary Magdalene.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_baseball", "title": null, "content": ["\n\n", "The question of the origins of ", " has been the subject of debate and controversy for more than a century. Baseball and the other modern ", " – ", ", ", " and ", " – were developed from folk games in early Britain, Ireland, and Continental Europe (such as France and Germany). Early forms of baseball had a number of names, including \"base ball\", \"goal ball\", \"round ball\", \"fetch-catch\", \"stool ball\", and, simply, \"base\". In at least one version of the game, teams pitched to themselves, runners went around the bases in the opposite direction of today's game, much like in the Nordic ", ", and players could be put out by being hit with the ball. Just as now, in some versions a batter was called out after three strikes.\n", "Although much is unclear, as one would expect of children's games of long ago, this much is known: by the mid-18th century a game had appeared in the south of England which involved striking a pitched ball and then running a circuit of bases. Rounders is referenced in 1744 in the children's book ", " where it was called Base-Ball.", " English colonists took this game to North America with their other pastimes, and in the early 1800s variants were being played on both sides of the ocean under many appellations.  However, the game was very significantly altered by amateur men's ball clubs in and around New York City in the middle of the 19th century, and it was this heavily revised sport that became modern baseball.\n", "A number of folk games in ", " and ", " had characteristics that can be seen in modern ", " (as well as in ", " and ", "). Many of these early games involved a ball that was thrown at a target while an opposing player defended the target by attempting to hit the ball away. If the batter successfully hit the ball, he could attempt to score points by running between bases while fielders would attempt to catch or retrieve the ball and put the runner out. \nFolk games differed over time, place, and culture, resulting in similar yet variant forms. These games had no standard documented rules and instead were played according to historical customs. These games tended to be played by working classes, peasants, and children. Early folk games were often associated with earlier religious ceremonies and worship rituals. These games became discouraged and even altogether prohibited by subsequent governing states and religious authorities.", "\n", "Aside from obvious differences in terminology, the games differed in the equipment used (ball, bat, club, target, etc., which were usually just whatever was available), the way in which the ball was thrown, the method of scoring, the method of making outs, the layout of the field and the number of players involved. Very broadly speaking, these games can be roughly divided into forms of ", ", where the batter ran out to a single point or line and back, as in cricket, and ", ", where there was a circuit of multiple bases. There were also games (e.g. stool-ball, trap-ball) which involved no running at all.\n", "Oină is a Romanian traditional sport, a form of ", " similar in many ways to ", ".\n", "The name \"oină\" was originally \"hoina\",", " and is derived from the ", " word ", " \"game\" (a cognate of Turkish ", ").", " \nThe oldest direct mention comes from 1364.", "\n", "In 1899, ", ", the minister of education decided that oină was to be played in schools in ", " classes.

The earliest known reference to stoolball is in a 1330 poem by ", ", who recommended to priests that the game be forbidden within churchyards.\n", "In stoolball, one player throws the ball at a target while another player defends the target. Originally, the target was defended with a bare hand. Later, a bat of some kind was used (in modern stoolball, a bat like a very heavy ", " paddle is used). \"Stob-ball\" and \"stow-ball\" were regional games similar to stoolball. What the target originally was in stoolball is not certain; it was possibly a tree stump, since \"", "\" and \"", "\" all mean ", " in some local dialects. (\"", "\" could also refer to a type of frame used in mining). It is notable that in cricket to this day, the uprights of the ", " are called \"stumps\". Of course, the target could well have been whatever was convenient, perhaps even a gravestone (hence Pagula's objection to churchyard play). A 17th-century book on games specifies a stool.\n", "According to one legend, milkmaids played stoolball while waiting for their husbands to return from the fields. Another theory is that stoolball developed as a game played after attending church services, in which case the target was probably a church stool. An 18th-century poem depicts men and women playing together (the women using their aprons to catch batted balls), and it and other references associate the game especially with the Easter season.", "\n", "There were several versions of stoolball. In the earliest versions, the object was primarily to defend the stool. Successfully defending the stool counted for one point, and the batter was out if the ball hit the stool. There was no running involved. Another version of stoolball involved running between two stools, and scoring was similar to the ", ". In perhaps yet another version there were several stools, and points were scored by running around them as in baseball.\n", "When Englishmen came to America, they brought stoolball with them. ", " in his diary for Christmas Day, 1621, noted (with disapproval) how the men of Plymouth were \"frolicking in þe street, at play openly; some pitching þe barre, some at stoole-ball and shuch-like sport\".", " Because of the different versions of stoolball, and because it was played not only in England, but also in colonial America, stoolball is considered by many to have been the common ancestor of cricket, baseball and rounders.\n", "In tut-ball or pize-ball,", " which was similar to both stoolball and rounders, the corners of the infield were marked by \"tuts\" (sods or pieces of brick that marked the bases) rather than stools, and the batter generally hit with their hand.", "\n", "Another early folk game was \"dog and cat\" (or \"cat and dog\"), which probably originated in Scotland. In cat and dog an oblong piece of wood called a ", " is thrown at a hole in the ground while another player defends the hole with a stick (a ", "). In some cases there were two holes and, after hitting the cat, the batter would run between them while fielders would try to get the runner out by putting the cat in the hole before the runner got to it. Dog and cat thus resembled cricket.\n", "This game, otherwise unknown, was described in ", " (ca. 1670), which included rules for over 130 pastimes including stool-ball and stow-ball.", " It is significant in that it involved both a bat and base-running, although it was played with a wooden cat rather than a ball and the multiple \"bases\" were holes in the ground: the batter reached safety by putting the end of his bat in a hole before the fielders could put the cat in it. This has echoes in cricket's manner of scoring runs by touching the bat to the ground across the ", " before the fielders can hit the nearby wicket with the ball.", "\n", "In trap ball, played in England since the 14th century, a ball was thrown in the air, to be hit by a batsman and fielded. In some variants a member of the fielding team threw the ball in the air; in some, the batter tossed it himself as in fungo; in others, the batsman caused the ball to be tossed in the air by a simple lever mechanism: versions of this, called ", " and ", ", are still played in some English pubs. In trap-ball there was no running, instead the fielders attempted to throw the ball back to within a certain distance of the batter's station. Trap-ball may be the origin of the concept of foul lines; in most variants the ball had to be hit between two posts to count.\n", "A related game was tip-cat; in this, the \"cat\" was an oblong piece of wood (as in dog-and-cat); it tapered toward each end, rather like a rugby ball or American football, so that striking one end would flip it into the air much like the trap in trap-ball so that it could be struck with a stick or bat.\n", "An old English game called \"", "\" or \"", "\", described by George Ewing at ", ", was apparently not much like baseball. There was no bat and no ball involved. The game was more like a fancy game of team \"tag\", although it did share the concept of places of safety, bases, with baseball.\n", "The ", " prior to 1650 is something of a mystery.

However, there is no consensus as to the rules that were used or whether it can be considered the first \"baseball\" game.", " A firsthand account and the rules of the game were recalled by Dr. Adam E. Ford, who had witnessed the game as a six-year-old boy, in an 1886 issue of ", " magazine in Denver, Colorado; he described the game in remarkable detail, including the precise distances between the irregular bases and how the ball was constructed. However, some historians, such as David Block, have expressed doubts as to the veracity and rather incredible specificity of Ford's memory, and indeed compared it to Abner Graves' very similar yarn about Abner Doubleday.", "\n", "In that letter, Ford refers to 'old grayhairs' at the time, who had played this game as children, suggesting that the origins of baseball in Canada go back into the 18th century. Very similar instances were recorded by ", " in his 1888 book ", ", in which he recounts several elderly men recalling having played as boys, covering a span from the 1790s to the 1830s; among others, ", " recalled playing at Harvard, from which he graduated in 1829.\n", "That baseball is based on older English games such as stool-ball, trap-ball and tip-cat with possible influences from ", " is difficult to dispute. On the other hand, baseball as played in the New World has many elements that are uniquely American. The earliest published author to muse on the origin of baseball, ", ", was suspicious of the often-parroted claim that rounders is the direct ancestor of baseball, as both were formalized in the same time period. He concluded, with some amount of patriotism, that baseball evolved separately from town-ball (i.e. rounders), out of children's \"safe haven\" ball games.", "\n", "Games played with ", " together may all be distant cousins; the same goes for base-and-ball games. Bat, base, and ball games for two teams that alternate in and out, such as baseball, cricket, and rounders, are likely to be close cousins. They all involve throwing a ball to a batsman who attempts to \"bat\" it away and run safely to a base, while the opponent tries to put the batter-runner out when liable (\"liable [to be put out]\" is the baseball term for unsafe). Certainly, baseball is ", " to cricket and rounders, but exactly how, or how closely, has not been established. The only certain thing is that cricket is much older than baseball, and that cricket was very popular in colonial America and the early United States, fading only with the explosive popularity of New York baseball after the Civil War. Baseball owes to cricket some adopted terminology, such as \"outs\", \"innings\", \"runs\" and \"umpires\". There was also, \"", "\", a countrified form of cricket once very popular in New England, which retained the old-fashioned wide, low two-stump ", ", and in which the large ball was rolled along the ground.\n", "The likelihood is that \"base ball\" and \"rounders\" (along with \"feeder,\" \"squares\" and other names) were regional appellations for the same boys' game played with varying rules in many parts of England from the early 1700s onward.", " Along with its relatives stool-ball and the cat games it crossed the ocean with English colonists, and eventually followed its own independent evolutionary path, at the same time that back in England what was now generally called \"rounders\" was developing separately.\n", "The game of \"cat\" (or \"", "\") had many variations but usually there was a pitcher, a catcher, a batter and fielders, but there were no sides (and often no bases to run). Often, as in English tip-cat, there was no pitcher and the \"cat\" was not a ball but an oblong wooden object, roughly football-shaped, which could be flipped into the air by striking one end, or simply a short stick which could be placed over a hole or stone and similarly flipped up. In other variants the batter himself tossed the ball into the air with his free hand, as in fungo. A feature of some versions of cat that would later become a feature of baseball was that a batter would be out if he swung and missed three times.\n", "Another game that was popular in early America was \"one ol' cat\", the name of which was possibly originally a contraction of ", ".", " In one ol' cat, when a batter is put out, the catcher goes to bat, the pitcher catches, a fielder becomes the pitcher, and other fielders move up in rotation. One ol' cat was often played when there weren't enough players to choose up sides and play townball. Sometimes running to a base and back was involved. \"Two ol' cat\" was the same game as one ol' cat, except that there were two batters; a diagram preserved in the New York Public Library is labeled \"Four Old Cat\" and depicts a square field like a baseball diamond and four batters, one at each corner.\n", "There are numerous 18th and early 19th-century references in England and especially America to \"bat and ball\". Unfortunately, there is no knowledge and information about the game besides the name, nor whether it was an alternate term for baseball or something else such as trap-ball, cat or even cricket. It might merely be a generic phrase for any game played with bat and ball. However, in 1859, ", " recalled of his childhood in New Hampshire in the 1810s:\n", "\n", "This \"bat and ball,\" at least, appears very clearly to be a form of early baseball/roundball/townball.\n", "Baseball, as it was before the rise to dominance of its altered New York variant in the 1850s and 60s, was known variously as base ball, town ball, round ball,", " round town, goal ball, field-base, three-corner cat, the New England game, or Massachusetts baseball. Generally speaking, \"round-ball\" was the most usual name in New England, \"base-ball\" in New York, and \"town-ball\" in Pennsylvania and the South. A diagram posted in the baseball collection on the New York Public Library's Digital Gallery website identifies a game played, \"Eight Boys with a ball & four bats playing [F]our Old Cat\"", " This game was apparently played on a square of 40 feet on each side, but the diagram does not make clear the rules or how to play the game.", " The same sheet of paper shows a diagram of a square – 60 feet per side with the base side having in its middle the \"Home Goal\", \"Catcher\", and \"Striker\", and with the corners marked as \"1st Goal\", \"2nd Goal\", \"3rd Goal\", and \"4th Goal\" as you travel counter-clockwise around the square. The note accompanying this diagram says, \"Thirty or more players (15 or more on each side) with a bat and ball playing Town Ball, some times called Round Ball, and subsequently the so-called Massachusetts game of Base Ball\".\n", "Early baseball or town-ball had many, many variants, as would be expected of an informal boys' game, and most differed in several particulars from the game which developed in New York in the 1840s. Besides usually (but not always) being played on a 'rectangle' rather than a 'diamond,' with the batter positioned between fourth and first base (there were also variants with three and five bases), it was played by various numbers of players from six to over thirty a side, in most but not all versions there was no foul territory and every batted ball was in play,", " innings were determined on the basis of either \"all out/all out\" as in cricket or \"one out/all out\", in many all out/all out versions there was an opportunity for the last batter to earn another inning by some prodigious feat of hitting, pitching was overhand (underhand pitching was mandatory in \"New York\" baseball until the 1880s),", " and, perhaps most significantly, a baserunner was put out by \"soaking\" or hitting him with a thrown ball, just as in French poison-ball and Gutsmuth's ", ".\n", "As mentioned above, in 1829 ", " was reprinted in Boston, including the rules of rounders, and Robin Carver's 1834 ", " copied the same rules almost verbatim but changed \"Rounders\" to \"Base or Goal ball\" because, as the preface states, those \"are the names generally adopted in this country\" – which also implies that the game was \"generally\" known and played. In 1833 the ", " was organized,", " and by 1837 the Gotham Base Ball Club would be formed in Manhattan, which would later split to form the Knickerbocker Club.\n", "1835 saw the publication of ", " which, confusingly, has chapters for both \"Base ball\" and \"Base, or Goal-ball\", which seem to be little if at all different; both were \"all out, all out\" townball with soaking and a three-strike rule. Of more interest is the fact that here appears the earliest use of the terms \"innings\" and \"diamond\".\n", "The early 1840s saw the formation of at least three more clubs in Manhattan, the New York,", " the Eagle and the Magnolia; another in Philadelphia, the Athletic; and even a club in Cincinnati. By 1851 the game of baseball was well-established enough that a newspaper report of a game played by a group of teamsters on Christmas Day referred to the game as \"a good old-fashioned game of base ball\",", " and the 1858 report of the ", " declared that \"The game of base-ball has long been a favorite and popular recreation in this country, but it is only within the last fifteen years that any attempt has been made to systematize and regulate the game.\"", "\n", "The older game was recognized as being very different in character from the new \"Knickerbocker\" style. The New York ", " of October 10, 1857, reported on a match between the Liberty Club of New Jersey and \"a party of Old Fogies who were in the habit of playing the old fashioned base ball, which as nearly everyone knows, is entirely different from the base ball as now played.\" In 1860, the Olympic Ball Club of Philadelphia voted to change over to the \"New York game\", several traditionalist members resigned in protest.", " That same year the rival Athletic Club traveled to ", " for a challenge match in which they competed against the local club in both town ball (the home team prevailed 45–43), and \"New York\" baseball (Athletic won easily, 34–2).\n", "Round-ball persisted in New England longer than in other regions and during the period of overlap was sometimes distinguished as the \"New England game\" or \"Massachusetts baseball\"; in 1858 a set of rules was drawn up by the Massachusetts Association of Base Ball Players at the ", " in ", ". This game was played by teams of ten to fourteen players with four bases 60 feet apart and no foul territory. The ball was considerably smaller and lighter than a modern baseball, and runners were still put out by \"soaking\".\n", "The ", " that ", " invented baseball in 1839 was once widely promoted and widely believed. There is no evidence for this claim except for the testimony of one unreliable man decades later, and there is persuasive counter-evidence. Doubleday himself never made such a claim; he left many letters and papers, but they contain no description of baseball or any suggestion that he considered himself prominent in the game's history. His ", " obituary makes no mention of baseball, nor does a 1911 Encyclopædia article about Doubleday. The story was attacked by baseball writers almost as soon as it came out, but it had the weight of Major League Baseball and the Spalding publishing empire behind it. Contrary to popular belief, Doubleday was never inducted into the ", ", although a large oil portrait of him was on display at the Hall of Fame building for many years.\n", "Doubleday's invention of baseball was the finding of a panel appointed by ", ", a former star pitcher and club executive, who had become the leading American sporting goods entrepreneur and sports publisher. Debate on baseball's origins had raged for decades, heating up in the first years of the 20th century, due in part to a 1903 essay baseball historian ", " wrote in ", "'s ", " stating that baseball gradually evolved from English game of “", "”.", " To end argument, speculation, and innuendo, Spalding organized the ", " in 1905. The members were baseball figures, not historians: Spalding's friend ", ", a former ", " president; two ", ", former NL president ", " and former Washington club president ", "; former NL president and lifelong secretary-treasurer ", "; two other star players turned sporting goods entrepreneurs (", " and ", "); and AAU president James E. Sullivan.", "\n", "The final report, published on December 30, 1907, included three sections: a summary of the panel's findings written by Mills, a letter by ", " supporting the panel, and a dissenting opinion by ", ". The research methods were, at best, dubious. Mills was a close friend of Doubleday, and upon Doubleday's death in 1893 Mills orchestrated his memorial service and burial.", " Doubleday had been a prominent member of the spiritualist ", ", in which Spalding's wife was deeply involved and in whose compound in San Diego Spalding was residing at the time. Wright and Reach were effectively Spalding's employees, as he had secretly bought out their sporting-goods businesses some years before.  AAU president and Commission secretary Sullivan was Spalding's personal factotum. Several other members had personal reasons to declare baseball as an \"American\" game, such as Spalding's strong ", " views.", " The Commission found an appealing story: baseball was invented in a quaint rural town without foreigners or industry, by a young man who later graduated from ", " and served heroically in the ", ", ", ", and U.S. wars against Indians.\n", "The Mills Commission concluded that Doubleday had invented baseball in ", " in 1839; that Doubleday had invented the word \"baseball\", designed the diamond, indicated fielders' positions, and written the rules. No written records in the decade between 1839 and 1849 have ever been found to corroborate these claims, nor could Doubleday be interviewed (he died in 1893). The principal source for the story was one letter from elderly ", ", who was a five-year-old resident of Cooperstown in 1839. Graves never mentioned a diamond, positions or the writing of rules. What's more, his reliability as a witness was challenged because he spent his final days in an asylum for the criminally insane.  Doubleday was not in Cooperstown in 1839 and may never have visited the town.", " He was enrolled at ", " at the time, and there is no record of any leave time. Mills, a lifelong friend of Doubleday, never heard him mention baseball, nor is there any mention of the game in Doubleday's autobiography. In character, Doubleday was bookish and sedentary, with no observable interest in athletics of any sort.\n", "Versions of baseball rules and descriptions of similar games have been found in publications that significantly predate his alleged invention in 1839. Despite this, the ballpark built in 1939 only a few blocks down from the Hall of Fame still bears the name \"Doubleday Field\". However, aside from the artificial intrusion of the person of Doubleday and the village of Cooperstown, the Mills report was not entirely incorrect in its broad outline: a game related to English rounders was played in America from early times; it was supplanted by a variant form which originated in New York circa 1840. But this development happened in urban New York City, not pastoral Cooperstown, and the men involved were neither farm boys nor West Point cadets.\n", "The earliest known published", " rules of baseball in the United States were written in 1845 for a New York City \"base ball\" club called the ", ".", " The purported organizer of the club, ", ", is one person commonly known as \"the father of baseball\". The rules themselves were written by the two-man Committee on By-Laws, Vice-president ", " and Secretary ", ". One important rule, the 13th, outlawed \"soaking\" or \"plugging\", putting a runner out by hitting him with a thrown ball, introducing instead the concept of the tag; this reflected the use of a farther-traveling and potentially injurious hard ball.", " Another significant rule, the 15th, specified three outs to an inning for the first time instead of \"one out, all out\" or \"all out, all out.\"  The 10th rule prescribed foul lines and foul balls and the 18th forbade runners advancing on a foul, unlike the \"Massachusetts game\" in which all batted balls were in play. The Knickerbockers also enlarged the diamond well beyond that of town ball, ", " to modern size depending on how \"paces\" is interpreted.", "\n", "Evolution from the so-called \"", "\" to the current rules is fairly well documented. The most significant differences were that overhand pitching was illegal, strikes were only counted if the batter swung and missed, \"wides\" or balls were not counted at all, a batted ball caught on the first bounce was an out, and a game was played to 21 \"aces\" or runs rather than for a set number of innings.\n", "It is noteworthy, however, that the Knickerbocker Rules did not cover a number of basic elements of the game. For example, there was no mention of positions or the number of players on a side, the pitching distance was unspecified, the direction of base-running was left open, and it was never stated, though implied, that an \"ace\" was scored by crossing home plate. In all likelihood, all of these matters except the first were considered so intrinsic to baseball by this time that they were assumed; the number of players on a side, however, remained a matter of debate among clubs", " until fixed at nine in 1857, the Knickerbockers arguing unsuccessfully for seven-man teams.\n", "On June 3, 1953, Congress officially credited Cartwright with inventing the modern game of baseball.  He was already a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1938 for various other contributions to baseball. However, the role of Cartwright himself in the game's invention has been disputed. According to ", "'s official historian, John Thorn, \"Cartwright's plaque in the Baseball Hall of Fame declares he set the bases 90 feet apart and established nine innings as a game and nine players as a team. He did none of these things, and every other word of substance on his plaque is false.\"", " His authorship may have been exaggerated in a modern attempt to identify a single inventor of the game, and heavily advanced by a relentless public-relations campaign by his grandson. The 1845 Rules themselves are signed by the \"Committee on By-Laws\", ", " and ", ". There is evidence that these rules had been experimented with and used by New York ball clubs for some time; Cartwright, in his 1848 capacity as club secretary (and a bookseller), was merely the first to have them printed up.\n", " Further evidence of a more collective model of New York baseball's development, and doubts as to Cartwright's role as \"inventor\", came with the 2004 discovery of a newspaper interview with ", ", a founding member of the Gotham Baseball Club in 1837 and first vice president of the Knickerbocker Club, and co-author of its rules, eight years later.\n", "\n", "\n", "If Wheaton's account, given in 1887, was correct, then most of the innovations credited to Cartwright were, in fact, the work of the Gothams before the Knickerbockers were formed, including a set of written rules. John Thorn, ", "'s official historian, argued in his book ", " that four members of the Knickerbockers, namely Wheaton, ", ", ", " and ", ", have stronger claims than Cartwright as \"inventors\" of modern baseball.", "\n", "Legend holds that Cartwright also introduced the game in most of the towns where he stopped on his trek west to California to find gold, a sort of Johnny Appleseed of baseball. This story, however, arose from forged entries in Cartwright's diary which were inserted after his death.\n", "It is however certain that Cartwright, a New York bookseller who later caught ", ", umpired a game in Hoboken, New Jersey on June 19, 1846.  The game ended, and the Knickerbockers' opponents (the New York nine)", " won, 23–1. This was long believed to be the first recorded U.S. baseball game between organized clubs. However, at least three earlier reported games have since been discovered: on October 10, 1845, a game was played between the New York Ball Club and an unnamed", " club from Brooklyn, at the Union Star Cricket Grounds in Brooklyn; the New Yorks lost 22 to 1. The game was reported in the ", " and ", ", making it the first ever published baseball result. The New Yorks and Brooklyns played two more games on October 21 and 24, with the first on the New Yorks' home diamond at Elysian Fields and the rematch at the Star Cricket Grounds again.", "\n", "One point undisputed by historians is that the modern professional major leagues that began in the 1870s developed directly from the amateur urban clubs of the 1840s and 1850s, not from the pastures of small towns such as Cooperstown.\n", "In 1845, the ", " began using ", " in ", " to play ", ", following the New York and Magnolia Ball Clubs which had begun playing there in 1843.\n", "At a preliminary meeting [of the Knickerbockers], it was suggested that as it was apparent they would soon be driven from Murray Hill, some suitable place should be obtained in New Jersey, where their stay could be permanent; accordingly, a day or two afterwards, enough to make a game assembled at Barclay street ferry, crossed over, marched up the road, prospecting for ground on each side, until they reached the Elysian Fields, where they \"settled.\"", "On October 21, 1845, the New York Ball Club played the second of their three games against a Brooklyn team there, the series being the first known inter-club baseball games. In June 1846 the Knickerbockers played the \"New York nine\" (probably the same New York Ball Club) in the first baseball game played between clubs according to codified rules.

A fifth stage (adjourning) was added in 1977 when a new set of studies were reviewed (Tuckman & Jensen, 1977).", "\n", "Each of the five stages in the ", " model proposed by Tuckman involves two aspects: ", " and ", ". Such a distinction is similar to Bales' (1950) ", " equilibrium model which states that a group continuously divides its attention between instrumental (task-related)  and expressive (socioemotional) needs.\n", "As Gersick (1988) ", " has pointed out, some later  models followed similar sequential patterns.  Examples include: define the situation, develop new skills, develop appropriate roles, carry out the work (Hare, 1976);", " orientation, dissatisfaction, resolution, production, termination (LaCoursiere, 1980);", " and generate plans, ideas, and goals; choose & agree on alternatives, goals, and policies; resolve conflicts and develop norms; perform action tasks and maintain cohesion (McGrath, 1984).", "\n", "Stewart Tubbs \"systems\" approach to studying small group interaction led him to the creation of a four-phase model of group development:\n", "Fisher outlines four phases through which task groups tend to proceed when engaged in decision making. By observing\nthe distribution of act-response pairs (a.k.a. \"interacts\") across different moments of the group process, Fisher noted how the interaction changed as the group decision was formulated and solidified. His method pays special attention to the \"content\" dimension of interactions by classifying statements in terms of how they respond to a decision proposal (e.g. agreement, disagreement, etc.).\n", "Based on this categorization, Fisher created his \"Decision Proposal Coding System\" that identifies act-response pairs associated with each decision-making phase.  He observed that the group decision-making process tended to be more cyclical and, in some cases, almost erratic. He hypothesized that the interpersonal demands of discussion require \"breaks\" from task work.  In particular, Fisher observed that there are a number of contingencies that might explain some of the decision paths taken by some groups.  For instance, in modifying proposals, groups tend to follow one of two patterns.  If conflict is low, the group will reintroduce proposals in less abstract, more specific language. When conflict is higher, the group might not attempt to make a proposal more specific but, instead, because disagreement lies on the basic idea, the group introduces substitute proposals of the same level of abstraction as the original.\n", "'s model suggests that different groups employ different sequences in making decisions. In contrast to unitary sequence models, the multiple sequences model addresses decision making as a function of several contingency variables: task structure, group composition, and conflict management strategies. Poole developed a descriptive system for studying multiple sequences, beyond the abstract action descriptions of previous studies. From Bales' Interaction Process Analysis System and Fisher's Decision Proposal Coding System, Poole proposes 36 clusters of group activities for coding group interactions and 4 cluster-sets: proposal development, socioemotional concerns, conflict, and expressions of ambiguity. However, in his latter work, Poole rejected phasic models of group development and proposed a model of continuously developing threads of activity. In essence, discussions are not characterized by blocks of phases, one after another, but by intertwining tracks of activity and interaction.\n", "Poole suggests three activity tracks: task progress, relational, and topical focus. Interspersed with these are breakpoints, marking changes in the development of strands and links between them. Normal breakpoints pace the discussion with topic shifts and adjournments. Delays, another breakpoint, are holding patterns of recycling through information. Finally, disruptions break the discussion threads with conflict or task failure.\n", "McGrath's (1991) work emphasized the notion that different teams might follow different developmental paths to reach the same outcome. He also suggested that teams engage in four modes of group activity: ", ", and ", ". According to this model, modes \"are potential, not required, forms of activity\" (p. 153) resulting in Modes I and IV (inception and execution) being involved in all group tasks and projects while Modes II (technical problem solving) and III (conflict resolution) may or may not be involved in any given group activity (Hare, 2003 uses the terms ", ", ", ", ", ", and ", " for these four modes).\n", "McGrath further suggested that all team projects begin with Mode I (", ") and end with Mode IV (", ") but that Modes II and III may or may not be needed depending on the task and the history of the group's activities. McGrath contended that for each identified function, groups can follow a variety of alternative \"time-activity paths\" in order to move from the initiation to the completion of a given function. Specifically, TIP theory states that there is a \"default path\" between two modes of activity which is \"", "\" or \"least effort\" path, and that such default path will \"prevail unless conditions warrant some more complex path\" (1991, p. 159).\n", "This model also states that groups adopt these four modes with respect to each of three team functions: ", " and ", ". In this sense, groups are seen as \"always acting in one of the four modes with respect to each of the three functions, but they are not necessarily engaged in the same mode for all functions, nor are they necessarily engaged in the same mode for a given function on different projects that may be concurrent\" (McGrath, 1991, p. 153).

Her punctuated equilibrium model (Gersick, 1988, 1989, 1991) suggests that groups develop through the sudden formation, maintenance, and sudden revision of a \"framework for performance\". This model describes the processes through which such frameworks are formed and revised and predicts both the timing of progress and when and how in their development groups are likely, or unlikely, to be influenced by their environments. The specific issues and activities that dominate groups' work are left unspecified in the model, since groups' historical paths are expected to vary. Her proposed model works in the following way.\n", "Building on Tuckman's model and based on her own empirical research as well as the foundational work of ", ", Susan Wheelan proposed a \"unified\" or \"integrated\" model of group development (Wheelan, 1990; Wheelan, 1994a).  This model, although linear in a sense, takes the perspective that groups achieve maturity as they continue to work together rather than simply go through stages of activity.  In this model, \"early\" stages of group development are associated with specific issues and patterns of talk such as those related to dependency, counter-dependency, and trust which precede the actual work conducted during the \"more mature” stages of a group's life.  The table below describes each one of these phases.\n", "Based on this model, Wheelan has created and validated both a ", " (GDOS) and a ", " (GDQ).  The GDOS allows researchers to determine the developmental stage of a group by categorizing and counting each complete thought exhibited during a group session into one of eight categories: ", " statements, ", ", or ", " statements (Wheelan, 1994).  The GDQ is used to survey group members and assess their individual perception of their group's developmental state (Wheelan, S., & Hochberger, 1996). Her academic work has been transferred into a commercial organization, ", "\n", "In her empirical validation of the model, Wheelan (2003) has analyzed the relationship between the length of time that a group has been meeting and the verbal behavior patterns of its members as well as the member's perceptions of the state of development of the group.  Her results seem to indicate that there is a significant relationship between the length of time that a group had been meeting and the verbal behavior patterns of its members.  Also, members of older groups tended to perceive their groups to have more of the characteristics of Stage-3 and Stage-4 groups and to be more productive. Based on these results, Wheelan's position supports the traditional linear models of group development and casts doubt on the cyclic models and Gersick's punctuated equilibrium model.\n", "Combining multiple theories and the development models of Tuckman and Gersick, Morgan, Salas and Glickman (1994) created the Team Evolution and Maturation (TEAM) model to describe a series of nine developmental stages through which newly formed, task-oriented teams are hypothesized to evolve. The periods of development are labeled \"stages\" and conceived to be \"relatively informal, indistinct, and overlapping\", because \"sharp demarcations are not often characteristic of the dynamic situations in which operational teams work and develop\". According to this model, teams might begin a given period of development at different stages and spend different amounts of time in the various stages.  Teams are not always expected to progress in a linear fashion through all of the stages. A team's beginning point and pattern of progression through the stages depend on factors such as the characteristics of the team and team members, their histories and experience, the nature of their tasks, and the environmental demands and constraints (cf. McGrath, 1991).\n", "The TEAM model identities a total of ", ", seven central ones supplemented by two additional ones. The seven central stages begin with the formation of the team during its first meeting (forming) and moves through the members' initial, and sometimes unstable, exploration of the situation (storming), initial efforts toward accommodation and the formation and acceptance of roles (norming), performance leading toward occasional inefficient patterns of performance (performing-I), reevaluation and transition (reforming), refocusing of efforts to produce effective performance (performing-11), and completion of team assignments (conforming). The development of a team might be recycled from any of the final stages to an earlier stage if necessitated by a failure to achieve satisfactory performance or if adjustments to environmental demands are required or if problematic team interactions develop.\n", "The core stages of the model are preceded by a pre-forming stage that recognizes the forces from the environment (environmental demands and constraints) that call for, and contribute to, the establishment of the team; that is, forces external\nto the team (before it comes into existence) that cause the team to be formed. The last stage indicates that after the team has served its purpose, it will eventually be disbanded or de-formed. Here, individuals exit from the group (separately or\nsimultaneously) and the team loses its identity and ceases to exist.\n", "The TEAM model also postulates the existence of ", " present throughout all the stages. The first of these tracks involves activities that are tied to the specific task(s) being performed. These activities include interactions of the team members with tools and machines, the technical aspects of the job (e.g., procedures, policies, etc.), and other task-related activities.  The other track of activities is devoted to enhancing the quality of the interactions, interdependencies, relationships, affects, cooperation, and coordination of teams.\n", "The proponents of the model did not test its components or sequence of stages empirically but did confirm that the perceptions of team members concerning the performance processes of the team are perceived to include both team-centered and task-centered activities and that these perceptions seem to change over time as a result of team training.\n", "Since its beginning, the study of group dynamics has caused disagreement between researchers, as some maintain the focus should be at the individual-level, and others maintain the focus should be at the group-level. The Multilevel Perspective is an integration of these analyses into one unified approach. It suggests that group development and success can be best understood by taking into account components found at all levels of analysis.\n", "Group behavior can be broken down into 3 levels of analysis: the individual level (micro), the group level (meso) and the organizational or societal level (macro).\n", "Hackman (2003) warns that the scientific community has a tendency towards what is termed, “explanatory reductionism” or the tendency to believe that the workings of all natures systems can be explained by the properties of the parts that make them up. In truth, highly complex systems, such as groups, can have components that cannot be explained by looking at the properties of say, the individual. In order to get a true understanding of group dynamics, it is important that one focuses on the big picture.\n", "Hackman (2003) emphasizes this point via an example of his previous research on the effectiveness of airline cockpit crews. The study looked at 300 crews from various airlines located in the U.S., Europe, and Asia (Hackman, 1993). The crews varied based on success, and the current barriers they were facing, which included things such as economic difficulty and other external stressors.\n", "At first, the analysis included structural features (design of the flying task and the crew itself) that were assessed using methods that included surveys, interviews, and reviews of training and procedure manuals. Once the data analysis began, a one-way analysis of variance showed that the airlines had nearly no variation on measures of crew structure and behavior. These results were quite contradictory to what had been expected, but fortunately, Hackman had also collected data on a number of individual and contextual factors, just in case. At the individual level, it appeared as though the airlines once again did not vary significantly, but at the organizational level the source of variance was found. It turned out that the variability in crew success was related to each crew's organizational context. A total of five key features were determinants of crew success: adequacy of material resources, clarity of performance objectives, recognition and reinforcement for excellent crew performance, availability of educational and technical assistance, and availability of informational resources. If the researchers had chosen to collect data at just one level of analysis (e.g. the group level) the study would not have produced significant results.\n", "When studying group development and dynamics, it is important that all levels of analysis are taken into consideration. While it may be tempting to focus mainly at the group level, important information may be present either one level up (the organizational level) or one level down (the individual level).\n", " is a concept taken from the physical sciences. It challenges models that postulate linear and sequential processes, and instead suggests that development is inherently unpredictable. Chaos theory argues that it's unrealistic for a system to go through deterministic, predictable, and repeated stages. It was first applied to group development literature by McClure (1998) to suggest how groups never repeats themselves in the 'exact' same way, but that teams go through periods of chaos where the trajectory of the group is determined through conflict, turbulence, and uncertainty.", "\n", "However, there is some order that is created out of chaos. When a system is prone to be resolved in a certain way, but is not determined by a certain trajectory or constrained by time then this system is said to have a strange attractor. For groups, working as a functioning, effective team serves as the strange attractor, because this is the state groups naturally wish to return to after a chaotic period.", "\n", "This has been applied to research on hazing and initiation rituals ", " to examine how the process of initiation for sport teams place the group in an unfamiliar state, to which group development is unpredictable, and can result in various outcomes dependent on the individual and the leadership of the team. Further, the influence of leadership within a chaotic system has been examined to ascertain how turbulent processes can be managed or guided towards successful outcomes.", "\n", "Apart from the question of the validity of the research methods used and the generalizations that can be made based on the types of groups studied, there still remain some significant challenges in the study of group development. As some researchers have pointed out (e.g. Tuckman, 1965) group development models often provide only snapshots of groups at certain points of their history but do not fully describe the mechanisms of change, the \"triggers\" that lead to change or the amount of time that a group might remain in a  stage. Furthermore, naturally occurring groups tend to be highly sensitive to outside influences and environmental contingencies, but few models account for these influences.\n", "Models of \"small\" group development are also related to those of ", " but operate at a different level of analysis.  Despite their differences, both areas of work attempt to understand patterns and processes of collective change.  Both fields should strive to develop \"process-oriented\" theories, which according to Poole and Van de Ven (2004):\n", "A number of questions still remain unanswered in the study of group development over time.

This is far from the case; though the church became very wealthy over the Middle Ages and was prepared at times to spend lavishly on art, there was also much secular art of equivalent quality which has suffered from a far higher rate of wear and tear, loss and destruction.  The Middle Ages generally lacked the concept of preserving older works for their artistic merit, as opposed to their association with a saint or founder figure, and the following periods of the Renaissance and ", " tended to disparage medieval art.

The final goal is a unity of the soul with God, which is possible with Grace and the assistance of the Holy Spirit according to Gregory.", "\n", " (335-394) was a bishop who wrote, among others, about the creation of the human body. Unlike ", ", Gregory states, that the soul does not need to acquire the vision of God; it has this vision from the beginning.", " The mixing with body and material things let the soul deviate from its divine vision and fall. Human efforts must therefore be oriented toward recreating this vision and thus participating in the Divine life. This can be done, so Gregory, by turning away from evil, and returning to God. A human being is defined not by his/her body but by his/her soul, with its spiritual and intellectual capacities. The soul alone is in the image of God. Gregory also has a positive image of man by stating his freedom and independence. God is truly free and the freedom of man, even if limited, is an image of God. Not only his freedom, but also his ability to love  - God is love -  and his immortality, make man an image of God.", "\n", "Regarding the human body, Gregory opines that it is created for procreation. In that, humans are like animals; however, the human body also has the capacity for reasoning and perception. The body has three forms of life: the vegetative, sensual and intellectual. The human body derives its dignity from the fact that the Son of God had adopted it.", " But Gregory also considers the human body a heavy weight on the soul. The destination of man is to achieve similarity to God, through purification. Sin, passion and ambition must be renounced. The ", " of the Church are a great help. Gregory argues that God's ", ", not man's efforts, determines an individual's ability to see God. God draws man upwards towards him.", " He climbs step by step, without knowing where he is going.

Control of the body is essential for Christian life. Total control is virginity.  Virginity and perfect ", " ", " to the service of God allows the body to become the image of God. It is to Ambrose one of  the most precious treasures which Christ  has left as his  heritage to the Church. He asserted that perpetual virginity is a noble gift which the Christian religion has bestowed on the world. Virginity is not new or even Christian. ", " imposed this way of life on the ", " for a certain time. Ambrose writes, \"We read that also in the temple of Jerusalem there were virgins. But what does the ", " say? 'Now all these things happened to them in figure', that this might be a foreshadowing of what was to come.\"", " \"Mary is the model of virginity: No wonder that the Lord, wishing to rescue the world, began his work with Mary. Thus she, through whom salvation was being prepared for all people, would be the first to receive the promised fruit of salvation.\"", "\n", "\"To sow the seeds of perfect purity and to arouse a desire for virginity has always belonged to the function of the priesthood.\"", "Augustine is the father of many contemporary theological views on the body. He  dwelled at length on the condition of the human body before and after the fall. He was convinced that the heavenly state consisted in complete control of mind over body, especially in the area of sexuality.", " To illustrate this point, he notes, that some people can wiggle with their ears, nose or even hair, ", " at their will. This condition of complete freedom and absence of lust existed for human sexuality too before the fall.", " The body must be controlled, and therefore Augustine like his teacher Ambrose considered  virginity of the human body the superior way of Christ. He considered  matrimony a triple blessing in  light of its offspring, conjugal faith and being a sacrament: \"In conjugal faith it is provided that there should be no carnal intercourse outside the marriage bond with another man or woman; with regard to offspring, that children should be begotten of love, tenderly cared for and educated in a religious atmosphere; finally, in its sacramental aspect that the marriage bond should not be broken and that a husband or wife, if separated, should not be joined to another even for the sake of offspring. This we regard as the law of marriage by which the fruitfulness of nature is adorned and the evil of incontinence is restrained.\"", "\n", "He quoted ", " saying that young girls should marry, arguing that they \"should bear children to be mothers of families\".", " Augustine was one of the first and most important Church fathers who wrote, that ", " is wrong: \"Intercourse even with one's legitimate wife is unlawful and wicked where the conception of the offspring is prevented. ", ", the son of ", ", did this and the Lord killed him for it.\"", "\n", " deals with a number of questions, most importantly, the question of man as image of God.\n", "Since man is said to be the image of God by reason of his intellectual nature, he is the most perfectly like God according to that in which he can best imitate God in his intellectual nature. Now the intellectual nature imitates God chiefly in this, that God understands and loves Himself. Wherefore we see that the image of God is in man in three ways.", "This means, according to Thomas, that man has a natural aptitude for recognizing, understanding and loving God. However, he requires His grace to do those things perfectly so he can finally attain \"the likeness of glory\".", "\n", "But are animals also created in the image of God? Thomas has a unique answer: \nin all creatures there is some kind of likeness to God, he argued. But in the thinking person, whom he called \"the rational creature\", there is a likeness of \"image\"; whereas in other creatures we find a likeness by way of a \"trace\".", " Thomas explains the difference between trace and image. \"An 'image' represents something by likeness in ", " [...]; while a 'trace' represents something by way of an effect, which represents the cause in such a way as not to attain to the likeness of species.\"", "\n", "Catholic doctrine from early on and supported by the ", ", considered virginity  to be the holiest state for humans; however, marriage was allowed for those without the fortitude required to live an abstinent life. In ", ", ", " repeatedly quotes Augustine, who teaches, that  among the blessings of marriage, the child holds the first place. Pius XI also followed Augustine in upholding  the  indissolubility  of marriage and the wrongfulness of sexual acts that impede conception:\n", "Small wonder, therefore, if Holy Writ bears witness that the Divine Majesty regards with greatest detestation this horrible crime and at times has punished it with death. As St. Augustine notes, \"Intercourse, even with one's legitimate wife, is unlawful and wicked where the conception of the offspring is prevented.", "Following this argument, Pius XI  repeats  that the conjugal act is intrinsically tied with procreation, but also acknowledges the unitive aspect of intercourse as licit. The encyclical affirms the Church's opposition to adultery and divorce, and  speaks out against the ", " laws, popular at that time, that forbade those deemed \"unfit\" from marrying and having children.", "\n", " in the years 1939-1942 delivered a series of lectures to the newly ", " couples of ", " which for decades became the basis for marital instruction in the ", ".", " Like Popes before him, and following the teachings of the ", ", Pope Pius explained in ", " that virginity is superior to marriage.", " He also rejects the view that the human body needs fulfillment of the sexual instinct for the sake of one's mental or physical health, or for the harmony of one's personality.", " In this context he criticized the cult of the body and disorderly love of oneself.\n", "In a 1951 speech to ", ", Pius XII stressed the inviolability of the human body as a creation of God and stated his opposition to all forms of genetic mercy killings. The right to life comes directly from God, not from the parents.", " He rejected any kind of sterilization as well. Like Pius XI, he extolled the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, a place for peace and love, requiring often heroism by both partners. Parents have a role, not only to give physical love, but also to give spiritual life to their offspring. Pius criticized the traditional male role in marriage, stating that while the male member is head of the family, he should also ", ",", " especially within families, where the mother is working full-time. Pius XII demands ", " for equal work.\n", "Regarding ", " methods, Pope Pius XII distinguished between engaging in sexual intercourse during infertile days and the specific selection of these days for intercourse. He argued that, if a marital partner entered marriage with the intention to have intercourse only during infertile days in order to avoid having offspring, the marriage contract itself would be invalid. If, on the other hand, the marital partner has intercourse during infertile days only occasionally but not exclusively, then the marriage is legitimate. The intention, not the actual use of marital rights, is decisive. Pius XII illustrates this with the notion that marriage includes both rights and obligations.", "\n", " within marriage is also highlighted in his teachings. Pius took issue with the argument that abstinence is an impossibly heroic act. Citing Augustine, he argued that if natural union is not possible, abstinence is required. And, he added, in the time of ", ", so many acts of real heroism were required of men and women in so many countries, against which sexual abstinence paled in comparison.", " The human body and its needs should not be the centre of gratification but need to be sublimated to spiritual priorities that reflect the divine design and destiny. Marriage is not the highest value and human dignity must be preserved and applied in the marital act.", " The teachings of the Church reject a hedonistic view of the human body, while recognizing and valuing its divine origin and dignity.

For these reasons, the Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter - for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that ", " are immediately created by God.", " In an October 22, 1996, address to the ", ", ", " repeated the position of Pius XII adding:\n", "In his encyclical ", " (1950), my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation, provided that we do not lose sight of certain fixed points....Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis.", "To the Catholic Church, Pius XII's 1950 dogma of the Assumption is proof for the resurrection of the body from the dead. Pius was confident that the solemn proclamation and definition of the Assumption would contribute in no small way to the advantage of human society and individuals. He hoped that those who meditate upon the Assumption of Mary will be better able to withstand the pressures of a material life style, and look instead at the true destination of their own bodies:\n", "...in this magnificent way all may see clearly to what a lofty goal our bodies and souls are destined.

The Pope begins with the statement that \"the  transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator.\" He claims that this is a source of great joy to them, although it means many difficulties and hardships. But there are global perspectives. A rapid increase in population has created the spectre of a world without food and other resources for all, and a temptation for State authorities to clamp down on population increase with drastic measures. The role of woman in society has been changing drastically; but most importantly, according to the encyclical, the advent of birth control devices requires a position on the part of the magisterium of  the Church.\n", "The Pope points to some ", ". Human procreation, like all questions of life, is a part of God's loving design. Married life takes its origin from God, who \"is love.\" Husband and wife cooperate with God in the generation and rearing of new lives.", " Married love must therefore be more than a question of natural instinct or emotional drive. It is faithful and exclusive until death.", " Parents are not free to act as they choose in the service of transmitting life, as if it were wholly up to them to decide what is the right course to follow.", " Observing the Natural Law means that each and every marital act must of necessity retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of human life.", "\n", " means to experience married love while respecting the laws of conception and to acknowledge that one is not the master of the sources of life but rather the minister of the design established by the Creator.

Outside of the Underground Railroad, enslaved Black people went further south to ensure their freedom. Black people also formed their own organized networks and means of escape from slavery to Florida, where Black people negotiated with Native Americans and the Spanish government, and were able to live self-determined and free lives. Formerly enslaved people formed their own towns, military, and merged with the Florida population as Seminoles.

The first year after the Civil War began, slave patrols increased. Confederates were expecting slave revolts, which inspired them to appoint more patrols.

White men who would have served in slave patrols had they remained in their communities, went to serve in the Confederate army.

The head of the mandrel also expands the blind end of the rivet to a diameter greater than that of the drilled hole, compressing the fastened sheets between the head of the rivet and the head of the mandrel. At a predetermined tension, the mandrel breaks at the necked location. With open tubular rivets, the head of the mandrel may or may not remain embedded in the expanded portion of the rivet, and can come loose at a later time. More expensive closed-end tubular rivets are formed around the mandrel so the head of the mandrel is always retained inside the blind end after installation. \"Pop\" rivets can be fully installed with access to only one side of a part or structure.", "\n", "Prior to the invention of blind rivets, installation of a rivet typically required access to both sides of the assembly: a rivet hammer on one side and a bucking bar on the other side. In 1916, Royal Navy reservist and engineer Hamilton Neil Wylie filed a patent for an \"improved means of closing tubular rivets\" (granted May 1917).", " In 1922 Wylie joined the British aircraft manufacturer ", " Ltd to advise on metal construction techniques; here he continued to develop his rivet design with a further 1927 patent", " that incorporated the pull-through mandrel and allowed the rivet to be used ", ". By 1928, the George Tucker Eyelet Company, of Birmingham, England,", " produced a \"cup\" rivet based on the design. It required a separate ", " mandrel and the rivet body to be hand-assembled prior to use for the building of the ", ". Together with Armstrong-Whitworth, the Geo. Tucker Co. further modified the rivet design to produce a one-piece unit incorporating a mandrel and rivet.", " This product was later developed in aluminium and trademarked as the \"POP\" rivet. The ", " produced the design in the U.S. as inventors such as Carl Cherry and ", " experimented with other techniques for expanding solid rivets.\n", "They are available in flat head, countersunk head, and modified flush head with standard diameters of ", ", ", ", and ", " inch (3.2, 4.0, and 4.8 mm). Blind rivets are made from soft aluminum alloy, steel (including stainless steel), copper, and ", ".\n", "There are also ", ", which are designed to take shear and tensile loads.", "\n", "The rivet body is normally manufactured using one of three methods: wire (the most common method), tube (common in longer lengths, not normally as strong as wire) and sheet (least popular and generally the weakest option).", "\n", "There is a vast array of specialty blind rivets that are suited for high strength or plastic applications. Typical types include:\n", "Internally and externally locked structural blind rivets can be used in aircraft applications because, unlike other types of blind rivets, the locked mandrels cannot fall out and are watertight. Since the mandrel is locked into place, they have the same or greater shear-load-carrying capacity as solid rivets and may be used to replace solid rivets on all but the most critical stressed aircraft structures.\n", "The typical assembly process requires the operator to install the rivet in the nose of the tool by hand and then actuate the tool. However, in recent years automated riveting systems have become popular in an effort to reduce assembly costs and repetitive disorders. The cost of such tools ranges from US$1,500 for auto-feed pneumatics to US$50,000 for fully robotic systems.\n", "While structural blind rivets using a locked mandrel are common, there are also aircraft applications using \"non-structural\" blind rivets where the reduced, but still predictable, strength of the rivet without the mandrel is used as the design strength. A method popularized by Chris Heintz of ", " uses a common flat-head (countersunk) rivet which is drawn into a specially machined nosepiece that forms it into a round-head rivet, taking up much of the variation inherent in hole size found in amateur aircraft construction. Aircraft designed with these rivets use rivet strength figures measured with the mandrel removed.", "\n", "Oscar rivets are similar to blind rivets in appearance and installation but have splits (typically three) along the hollow shaft. These splits cause the shaft to fold and flare out (similar to the wings on a toggle bolt's nut) as the mandrel is drawn into the rivet. This flare (or flange) provides a wide bearing surface that reduces the chance of rivet pull-out. This design is ideal for high-vibration applications where the back surface is inaccessible.\n", "A version of the Oscar rivet is the Olympic rivet which uses an aluminum mandrel that is drawn into the rivet head. After installation, the head and mandrel are shaved off flush resulting in an appearance closely resembling a brazier head-driven rivet. They are used in the repair of ", " trailers to replicate the look of the original rivets.\n", "A drive rivet is a form of blind rivet that has a short ", " protruding from the head that is driven in with a hammer to flare out the end inserted in the hole. This is commonly used to rivet wood panels into place since the hole does not need to be drilled all the way through the panel, producing an aesthetically pleasing appearance. They can also be used with plastic, metal, and other materials and require no special setting tool other than a hammer and possibly a backing block (steel or some other dense material) placed behind the location of the rivet while hammering it into place. Drive rivets have less clamping force than most other rivets. Drive screws, possibly another name for drive rivets, are commonly used to hold nameplates into blind holes. They typically have spiral threads that grip the side of the hole.", "\n", "These resemble an ", " except the shaft snaps below the surface when the tension is sufficient. The blind end may be either ", " ('flush') or dome-shaped.\n", "One early form of blind rivet that was the first to be widely used for aircraft construction and repair was the Cherry friction-lock rivet. Originally, Cherry friction locks were available in two styles, hollow shank pull-through and self-plugging types. The pull-through type is no longer common; however, the self-plugging Cherry friction-lock rivet is still used for repairing light aircraft.\n", "Cherry friction-lock rivets are available in two head styles, universal and 100-degree countersunk. Furthermore, they are usually supplied in three standard diameters, 1/8, 5/32 and 3/16 inch.\n", "A friction-lock rivet cannot replace a solid shank rivet, size for size. When a friction lock is used to replace a solid shank rivet, it must be at least one size larger in diameter because the friction-lock rivet loses considerable strength if its center stem falls out due to vibrations or damage.\n", "Self-pierce riveting (SPR) is a process of joining two or more materials using an engineered rivet.", " Unlike solid, blind and semi-tubular rivets, self-pierce rivets do not require a drilled or punched hole.", "\n", "SPRs are cold-forged to a semi-tubular shape and contain a partial hole to the opposite end of the head. The end geometry of the rivet has a chamfered poke that helps the rivet pierce the materials being joined.  A hydraulic or electric servo rivet setter drives the rivet into the material, and an ", " die provides a cavity for the displaced bottom sheet material to flow. The SPR process is described in here ", ".\n", "The self-pierce rivet fully pierces the top sheet material(s) but only partially pierces the bottom sheet. As the tail end of the rivet does not break through the bottom sheet it provides a water or gas-tight joint. With the influence of the upsetting die, the tail end of the rivet flares and interlocks into the bottom sheet forming a low profile button.\n", "Rivets need to be harder than the materials being joined.", " they are heat treated to various levels of hardness depending on the material's ductility and hardness. Rivets come in a range of diameters and lengths depending on the materials being joined; head styles are either flush countersunk or pan heads.\n", "Depending on the rivet setter configuration, i.e. hydraulic, servo, stroke, nose-to-die gap, feed system etc., cycle times can be as quick as one second. Rivets are typically fed to the rivet setter nose from tape and come in cassette or spool form for continuous production.\n", "Riveting systems can be manual or automated depending on the application requirements; all systems are very flexible in terms of product design and ease of integration into a manufacturing process.\n", "SPR joins a range of dissimilar materials such as steel, aluminum, plastics, composites and pre-coated or pre-painted materials.", " Benefits include low energy demands, no heat, fumes, sparks or waste and very repeatable quality.\n", "Compression rivets are commonly used for functional or decorative purposes on clothing, accessories, and other items. They have male and female halves that press together, through a hole in the material. ", " have aesthetic caps on both sides. ", " have caps on just one side; the other side is low profile with a visible hole. ", " are commonly used to attach handles to knife blades and other utensils.\n", "A ", " is used primarily on external metal surfaces where good appearance and the elimination of unnecessary ", " are important. A flush rivet takes advantage of a countersunk or dimpled hole; they are also commonly referred to as countersunk rivets. Countersunk or flush rivets are used extensively on the exterior of aircraft for aerodynamic reasons such as reduced drag and turbulence. Additional post-installation machining may be performed to perfect the airflow.\n", "Flush riveting was invented in America in the 1930s by ", " and his team at ", ".", " The technology was used by ", " in the design and production of his H-1 plane, the ", ".\n", "The last commonly used high-strength structural steel rivets were designated ASTM A502 Grade 1 rivets.", "\n", "Such riveted structures may be insufficient to resist seismic loading from ", " if the structure was not engineered for such forces, a common problem of older steel bridges. This is because a hot rivet cannot be properly heat treated to add strength and hardness. In the ", " of such structures, it is common practice to remove critical rivets with an ", ", precision ", " the hole, then insert a machined and heat-treated bolt.\n", "The main official standards relate more to technical parameters such as ", " and ", " than physical length and diameter. They are:\n", "Rivet diameters are commonly measured in ", "-inch increments", " and their lengths in ", "-inch increments, expressed as \"dash numbers\" at the end of the rivet identification number.  A \"dash 3 dash 4\" (XXXXXX-3-4) designation indicates a ", "-inch diameter and ", "-inch (or ", "-inch) length. Some rivets lengths are also available in ", ", and have a dash number such as –3.5 (", " inch) to indicate they are half-size. The letters and digits in a rivet's identification number that precede its dash numbers indicate the specification under which the rivet was manufactured and the head style. On many rivets, a size in 32nds may be stamped on the rivet head.  Other makings on the rivet head, such as small raised or depressed dimples or small raised bars indicate the rivet's alloy. To become a proper fastener, a rivet should be placed in a hole ideally 4–6 thousandths of an inch larger in diameter.  This allows the rivet to be easily and fully inserted, then setting allows the rivet to expand, tightly filling the gap and maximizing strength.\n", "Rivet diameters and lengths are measured in ", ". Conveniently, the rivet diameter relates to the drill required to make a hole to accept the rivet,  rather than the actual diameter of the rivet, which is slightly smaller. This facilitates the use of a simple ", " to check both rivet and drill are compatible. For general use, diameters between 2 mm – 20 mm and lengths from 5 mm – 50 mm are common. The design type, material and any finish is usually expressed in plain language (often English).\n", "Before ", " techniques and ", " were developed, metal-framed buildings and ", " such as the ", ", ", " and the ", " were generally held together by riveting, as were ", " ", ". Riveting is still widely used in applications where light ", " and high strength are critical, such as in an aircraft. ", " alloys used in aircraft skins are generally not welded, because the aircraft in high-speed flight skins will be stretched, extrusion may occur deformation and change in ", ". Riveting can reduce the vibration transmission between joints, thereby reducing the risk of cracking. The firmness is better and more reliable against such repeated stress changes. In order to reduce air resistance, countersunk rivets are generally used in aircraft skins.", "\n", "A large number of countries used rivets in the construction of armored ", " during World War II, including the ", " (General Grant) manufactured in the United States. However, many countries soon learned that rivets were a large weakness in tank design since if a tank was hit by a large projectile it would dislocate the rivets and they would fly around the inside of the tank and injure or kill the crew, even if the projectile did not penetrate the armor. Some countries such as Italy, Japan, and Britain used rivets in some or all of their tank designs throughout the war for various reasons, such as lack of welding equipment or inability to weld very thick plates of armor effectively.\n", "Blind rivets are used almost universally in the construction of plywood ", ".\n", "Common but more exotic uses of rivets are to reinforce ", " and to produce the distinctive sound of a ", ".\n", "The ", " and ", " in a rivet are analyzed like a bolted joint. However, it is not wise to combine rivets with bolts and screws in the same joint. Rivets fill the hole where they are installed to establish a very tight fit (often called an interference fit). It is difficult or impossible to obtain such a tight fit with other fasteners. The result is that rivets in the same joint with loose fasteners carry more of the load—they are effectively stiffer. The rivet can then fail before it can redistribute load to the other loose-fit fasteners like bolts and screws. This often causes ", " of the joint when the fasteners ", ". In general, a joint composed of similar fasteners is the most efficient because all fasteners reach capacity simultaneously.\n", "A hammer is also used to \"ring\" an installed rivet, as a ", " for tightness and imperfections.  The inspector taps the head (usually the factory head) of the rivet with the hammer while touching the rivet and base plate lightly with the other hand and judges the quality of the audibly returned sound and the feel of the sound traveling through the metal to the operator's fingers.  A rivet tightly set in its hole returns a clean and clear ring, while a loose rivet produces a recognizably different sound.\n", "A blind rivet has strength properties that can be measured in terms of shear and tensile strength. Occasionally rivets also undergo performance testing for other critical features, such as pushout force, break load and salt spray resistance. A standardized ", " according to the Inch Fastener Standards is widely accepted.", "\n", "The shear test involves installing a rivet into two plates at specified hardness and thickness and measuring the force necessary to shear the plates. The tensile test is basically the same, except that it measures the pullout strength. Per the IFI-135 standard, all blind rivets produced must meet this standard.  These tests determine the strength of the rivet, and not the strength of the assembly. To determine the strength of the assembly a user must consult an engineering guide or the Machinery's Handbook.", "\n"]},

He tries to tell the people in the cave of his discovery, but they do not believe him and vehemently resist his efforts to free them so they can see for themselves (516e–518a).

It is only when the Tibetan Plateau heats up significantly more than the Himalayas that the ITCZ rises abruptly and swiftly shifts north, leading to the bursting of monsoon rains over the Indian subcontinent.\nThe reverse shift takes place for the northeast monsoon winds, leading to a second, minor burst of rainfall over the eastern Indian Peninsula during the Northern Hemisphere winter months.\n", "According to this theory, the onset of the southwest monsoon is driven by the shift of the subtropical westerly jet north from over the plains of India toward the Tibetan Plateau. This shift is due to the intense heating of the plateau during the summer months. The northward shift is not a slow and gradual process, as expected for most changes in weather pattern. The primary cause is believed to be the height of the Himalayas. As the Tibetan Plateau heats up, the low pressure created over it pulls the westerly jet north. Because of the lofty Himalayas, the westerly jet's movement is inhibited. But with continuous dropping pressure, sufficient force is created for the movement of the westerly jet across the Himalayas after a significant period. As such, the shift of the jet is sudden and abrupt, causing the bursting of southwest monsoon rains onto the Indian plains.

The basic assumption of the multiplier effect is that the economy starts with unused resources, for example, that many workers are cyclically unemployed and much of industrial capacity is sitting idle or incompletely used. By increasing demand in the economy, it is then possible to boost production. If the economy was already at full employment, with only structural, frictional, or other supply-side types of unemployment, any attempt to boost demand would only lead to inflation. The multiplier impact is frequently employed in ecotourism research to demonstrate the driving force behind tourism expenditure on the local economy.  However, there are still differing opinions in macroeconomics on the multiplier theory's validity, and different schools of thought have different understandings of the circumstances for its use and the mechanism by which it works.\n", "As an example, consider the government increasing its expenditure on roads by $1  million, without a corresponding increase in taxation.

These expenditures, in turn, will generate more jobs, wages, profits, and so on with the income and spending circulating the economy.\n", "The multiplier effect arises because of the induced increases in consumer spending which occur due to the increased incomes – and because of the feedback into increasing business revenues, jobs, and income again.

Member of Parliament for Assiniboia West, Nicholas Flood Davin, produced a report, known generally as the Davin Report, that recommended the establishment of a school system similar to that being created in the United States. One of its chief goals was to remove Aboriginal children from \"the influence of the wigwam\", which he claimed was stronger than that of existing day schools, and keep them instead \"constantly within the circle of civilized conditions\". While the history of the ", " (IRS) is a checkered one, much criticism has been levelled at both the system and those who established and supported it. Neglect and poor nutrition were often what Aboriginal children experienced, particularly in the early decades of the system's operation. The stripping away of traditional Native culture – sometimes referred to as \"cultural genocide\" – is another charge levelled at the residential schools. In many schools, students were not allowed to speak their Indigenous languages or practice any of their own customs, and thus lost their sense of identity, inevitably driving a cultural wedge between children and their family.", "\n", "By 1920, attendance at some sort of school was mandatory for Aboriginal children in Canada.

Enrollment statistics indicate that between 20% and 30% of Aboriginal children throughout the history of the IRS (Indian Residential Schools) system attended a residential school for at least a year, and many were enrolled for ten years or more. In some cases, children could return home on weekends and holidays, but for those in schools established far away from remote communities, this was not possible.\n", "The removal of children from their families and communities brought short and long term harm to many Native communities. While many schools had infirmaries and provided medical care in later decades, abuse of various kinds and crowded conditions in the first decades of the IRS history led to poor health and even death for a percentage of those enrolled. It has been argued that the psychological and emotional trauma resulting from both the abuse and the removal of the children from their families and culture has resulted in substance abuse, greater domestic violence, unemployability, and increased rates of suicide.", " In many cases, children leaving residential schools found themselves at an intersection of cultures, where they were no longer comfortable within their own cultures, yet not accepted into mainstream Canadian culture.

Chief Commissioner, Judge Murray Sinclair, has publicly declared the residential school system a deliberate act of cultural genocide against First Nations peoples. In its report, the commission submitted 94 recommendations to the Canadian government, recommendations which, if implemented, would substantially improve indigenous race relations, increase quality of life for survivors and extended families, and help undo the damage caused by residential schools. While the Liberal government, under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has committed itself to improving the lives of Canada's indigenous people, and specifically to implementing the TRC recommendations, some of those recommendations may be beyond the power of the Canadian government.

It is not unlikely for Aboriginal women living in poverty to not only tend to their own needs, but often tend to the needs of their elderly parents, care for loved ones in ill-health, as well as raising children; all of which is often supported only on a single income.

This is particularly true in the younger population (aged 15–34), where acts of violence are two and a half times more likely to occur than in the older population.

Lack of education, poverty, unemployment and abuse all lead to higher crime rates. Also, statistically, Aboriginals have a greater chance of conviction and subsequently, incarceration once convicted. They are also much less likely to receive parole during their sentence.", "\n", "The Canadian federal government is responsible for health and social services on the reserve and in Inuit communities, while the provincial and territorial governments provide services elsewhere.

It has not been until recently that the Canadian federal government had to increase recognition to the needs for programs and services for Aboriginal people in predominantly non-Aboriginal communities. It is however funding that lags the growth of urban Aboriginal populations and the uncoordinated delivery of services through various government departments would also pose as a barrier. The federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians pointed out that in 2003 almost 90 percent of the funding for programs designed for Aboriginal peoples is spent on reserves, while off-reserve programs for Aboriginal people are delivered through just 22 federal departments, as well as other provincial and territorial agencies.

Aboriginal individuals are generally diagnosed at a younger age than non-Aboriginal individuals, and Aboriginal females experience higher rates of gestational diabetes than non-Aboriginal females. The complications and prevalence of diabetes are seen among the Aboriginal population more often than non-Aboriginal population.

This leads to differing expectations and cultural clashes within the community, the family and the individual. At the community level, a general economic disadvantage is seen, exacerbated by unemployment and low education levels, leading to poverty, political disempowerment and community disorganization. The family suffers through a loss of tradition as they attempt to assimilate into mainstream Canadian culture. These lead to low self-esteem in the individual as First Nations culture and tradition are marginalized affecting one's sense of self-identity. These factors combine to create a world where First Nations individuals feel they cannot identify completely as Aboriginal, nor can they fully identify as mainstream Canadians.

A number of barefoot doctors left the medical profession after discovering that they could earn a better living from farming, and their services were not replaced. The leaders of brigades, through which local health care was administered, also found farming to be more lucrative than their salaried positions, and many of them left their jobs.
